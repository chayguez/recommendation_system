# Recommendation System

## Modules

1. **Community Optimizer (user-based module/unsupervised learning)** : looks for the community of users which is the most similar to our user
2. **Suggested Songs Fetching (item-based module/unsupervised learning)** : provides songs similar to our userâ€™s, out of a pool of songs retrieved from a community of users.
3. **Feedback-Driven Refiner (asynchronous module/supervised learning)** : updates the community based on client feedback from previous songs suggestion batches.

### Web Interface
1. **Login View**
   - Secure authentication via Spotify credentials.
   - Support for multiple clients with pre-registered test accounts.
   - Persistent background processing for logged-out users.
2. **Suggestion View**
   - Displays daily book suggestions with options to 'Like' or 'Dislike.'
   - User feedback refines future suggestions in real time.

### Backend Components
1. **Task Management**:
   - Asynchronous task execution using Celery.
   - Tasks include community optimization and suggestion computation.
2. **Algorithms**:
   - Iterative spectral clustering for fine-grained grouping of similar items.
   - Community-driven similarity score evaluation.

## Prompt Overview

The application requires three terminals for operation:

1. **Server Management**:
   - Run `python manage.py makemigrations`, `python manage.py migrate`, and `python manage.py runserver`.

2. **Celery Broker Management**:
   - Start with the command: `celery -A spotify worker --loglevel=info`.

3. **Celery Beat Management**:
   - Start with the command: `celery -A spotify beat -l info`.
